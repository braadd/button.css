### Welcome to button.css.
button.css is a css framework designed to allow you to create awesome looking buttons without spending a long time making buttons instead we have these buttons already made all you have to do is tell us what you want. Does that sound simple?



### Premade Buttons
Currently we only have one style of buttons which are metric and will have a design change depending on what our users (you) think about them we will update them. These premade buttons are coded to be nice on the server load thats why we use no images in our buttons just pure CSS.

### Templates
Currently we do not have a template so you can make your own button set. We will add that in on 1/7/2013 Monday or earlier send you template in and if we like it we may add it to the set or make it an addon.

### Authors
button.css was made by Brad L'estrange (@creativevex). Brad made button.css because whenever he started a new project he always had to code the buttons again and again which wasted time so instead to save himself and other people time he decided to make button.css so that there is no more full on coding maybe a color and size change but no style change. You can probably tell by now that Brad isn't very good at talking in 3rd person.
