button.css
=========

button.css is a small css frame work which allows you to create buttons on 
your website easier than ever. All you need to do is specify what syle, font, 
size and colour. You can even create your own. The index.html has an example
of how to do it you can also turn on or off the animation when you hover. 


This framework is only in beta and it most probably have bugs in there will
also be a design change to the buttons and I will add more button styles
I only started this on 26/06/13 and it took me 3 hours to plan and code this
part of it. If you find a bug or have an idea for this framework or want to 
work with me on it tweet me @bradlestrange I will reply and if you want to
have update about how the frame work is going follow me on twitter.

Note: Be nice. :)
